# Neighorhood Map Project

[Deployed Project Here](http://www.mapsterious.com)

 I made a few enhancements. Custom markers are used. When a menu location is selected, the map moves to center the selected location on the map.


I used the panTo function [described here on stack overload](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9335150/slow-down-google-panto-function/31203045)


Restaurant reviews are generated from the yelp api.


Recreation location and school information is from the wikipedia api
